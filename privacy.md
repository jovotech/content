<h3 id="audio-converter">Audio Converter</h3>

<h3 id="jovo-framework">Jovo Framework</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/jovotech/jovo-framework-nodejs/" target="_blank">Jovo Framework</a> is a free and open-source development library that you can download and use in your on code. We do not collect any usage data for the framework.</p>

<h3 id="jovo-cli">Jovo CLI</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/jovotech/jovo-cli/" target="_blank">Jovo CLI</a> is a free and open-source command line interface that allows you to create new Jovo projects and deploy those to both the Amazon Alexa and the Google Assistant platform (with Dialogflow).</p>
<p>When you create a new project with the <code>jovo new</code> command, you can specify a template (see the <a href="https://github.com/jovotech/jovo-templates/" target="_blank">Jovo Template Directory here</a>) that is then downloaded from the template engine on our server. To learn more about the popularity of those templates, we store the following information: The time of the download, the name of the template, and the location of the download (we don't store your IP address, which would allow us to track individual usage over time, and instead derive the location, e.g. <code>New York, NY</code>, from it to keep the data anonymized).</p>

<p>When you run the Jovo local server with the <code>jovo run</code> command, the Jovo Webhook is executed. More about this in the next section.</p>

<h3 id="jovo-webhook">Jovo Webhook</h3>

<p>The Jovo Webhook is a free tunnel service that allows you to prototype locally without having to upload your code to a server all the time.</p>        
<p>Jovo Webhool URLs look like this <code>https://webhook.jovo.cloud/[unique-id]</code>. The unique ID is automatically generated the first time a Jovo project is initialized, and stored to a file in <code>.jovo/config</code> in the <code>$HOME</code> directory of your computer. There is no account created by using the Jovo Webhook and we're not storing any personal data. You can always change the unique ID by editing the <code>config</code> file.</p>
<p>To be able to find potential bugs, we store very little information that is sent through the Jovo Webhook: The ID, the type of the request (Alexa or GoogleAction), and the time. If you wish, you can access (and even delete) all information that is stored to your unique ID by going to <a href="{{ route('webhook-logs', ['id' => 'unique-id']) }}" target="_blank">jovo.tech/webhook/logs/[unique-id]</a>.</p>
